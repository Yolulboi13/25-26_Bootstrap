                Fun Fact #3: In my notes app lies a note called Vicious Mockery. Over the years, I've accumulated my most powerful and creative insults into one coalescense of wordplay and terror for any they may be directed towards.
                <br><br>
                Highlights include: "You look like you regularly lose fights to small to medium-sized inanimate objects", calling someone a "Huckleberry chuckle-fairy cheese-sweating slop-muncher", and even reffering to one as "A mouth-breathing neckbeard that probably thinks that LMAO is how French people laugh, e.g. 'Haha, that's so le'mao'". That last bit must be done in a bad French accent or else it doesn't land.
                <br><br>
                Honestly, in hindsight, I'm definitely going to get relentlessly bullied if I try to use any of those in an actual argument. And there I thought these were actually pretty cool...

                Fun Fact #4: So I physically can't dream. At all. I used to be able to when I was younger, but once I was about 11 or 12, I stopped and haven't had a single dream since.
                <br><br>
                I do think it's kinda neat though. Like, who else can say they can't dream? A lot of people actually, now that I think about it, but I honestly kinda like it. No dreams means no nightmares, and I hated having those growing up.
                <br><br>
                But yeah, I think that's kinda cool, no? See, I knew you'd get it. Look at you, get smarter by the 1/6th of an hour!

                Fun Fact #5: I've been programming since I was in 4th grade. Albeit it was with Scratch of all things to use, but it was still something. It's where I came up with my username too.
                <br><br>
                My young little dummy self thought to combine such "cool kid" terms like "yo", "lol" but spelt lul cus that was cool and so like... yeah. Then I put "boi" at the end of it cus I was tiny, and then added my at the time age, giving me yolulboi10, my first ever username.
                <br><br>
                Pretty cool, huh? No? Yeah, I know it wasn't very good in hindsight, but it stuck, so...
